problem: deny access to app page to unauthorized users without denying access to login page

solution:
  configure webpack so that it outputs into two folders public and private
  output auth.html and auth.bundle.js into the public folder
  and app.html and app.bundle.js into the private folder
  Then you can statically serve the public folder

  set up a route so that if a get is sent to '/app'
    first a cookie is checked for
    if the cookie is found, send back app.html; otherwise send back a 403 forbidden

    if necessary, set up a similar route for app.bundle.js
